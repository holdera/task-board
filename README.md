This is a task board application where a user can create tasks and organize the tasks based on the task status of the following: to do, in progress, in qa or complete.


## Getting Started

This application uses node v20

To get this app running locally, enter the following in your terminal

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open a second terminal window, but keep the first one running. `cd` into the backend directory and run `npm install`. After all the packages have been installed, run `npm run app` to bet the back started. This is essential as the data will not load without the backend server running.
